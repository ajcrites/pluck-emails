# pluck-emails 
A very simple utility for plucking email addresses from a
list of contact information with typical email address
format:


    Jim Green <jgreen@example.com>, John Brown <jbrown@example.com>, Liam Yellow <lyellow@example.com>

With this utility, the result will be (by default):

    jgreen@example.com,jbrown@example.com,lyellow@example.com
